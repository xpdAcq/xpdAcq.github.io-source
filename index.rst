xpdAcq organization
*******************

Welcome to ``xpdAcq`` organization!

We are a group focusing on developing software toolkits for powder diffraction experiments.
Our focuses are, but not limited to, automation of experiments, real-time
data analysis and metadata management which enables future data mining.
We collaborate closely with `NSLS-II software team <http://nsls-ii.github.io/>`_, 
where is the home for many high quality software toolkits.

Currently we have released two ``Python`` packages:

  * ``xpdAcq`` 
    
    The package handles acquisition activities for experiment,
    ranging from executions to metadata management.

    For more information, please refer to `xpdAcq full document <https://xpdAcq.github.io/xpdAcq>`_.
    
    For a quick yet comprehensive introduction, please refer to `xpdAcq quickstart <https://xpdacq.github.io/xpdAcq/quickstart.html>`_.


  * ``xpdAn``
    
    The package provides a platform for live data analysis and
    visualization.

    For more information, please refer to `xpdAn full document <https://xpdAcq.github.io/xpdAn>`_.
    

This group is lead by `Professor Simon Billinge at Columbia University
<https://thebillingegroup.com/simon-billinge/>`_.
